# Bootstrap-Portfolio



## Description

 I built a responsive portfolio website using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a clean, modern design and a fully-functional portfolio single webpage. I used the Bootstrap grid system to create a responsive layout that looks great on all devices, and I implemented several Bootstrap components such as navbars, card groups, and models. I also used Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins to add interactivity to the site, such as a navbar button.

 I customized the default Bootstrap styles using CSS to match the brand's color scheme and fonts. I also created several custom styles to achieve the desired design.

 One of the challenges I faced while using Bootstrap was making sure the site looked good on different screen sizes. To solve this, I made extensive use of the grid system and made sure to test the site on multiple devices. Overall, I found Bootstrap to be a powerful and easy-to-use framework that helped me build a professional-quality web application in a short amount of time.
